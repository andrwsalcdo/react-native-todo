### React Native Todo App

My first jump into React Native by making the standard todo app that filters all, active and completed todos.

[react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view](https://github.com/APSL/react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view) was used for the scrolling effect when inline editing a todo.
